* Cut the drawn large map and calculate the main color value of each small graph, calculate the main color value of each icon at the same time, construct the color distance matrix between the small graph and the icon, and use the km algorithm to allocate each icon to the most similar small graph, and generate the construction of the large image with icon
    > draw_my_plot.py
